# dytionary

Still In Developement but put aside in favour of other projects
---------------------------------------------------------------

Required Libraries:
Requests, BeautifulSoup, Regex

How to start using it:

Class can be initialized by first having
Dytionary()
Then in the brackets we add the word we want to search

then after we select which method we want to use, we can use:

.defenition() <-- returns a string with the possible defenitions

.synonym() <-- returns a list of synonyms

.ant() <--returns a list of antonyms

.pos()  <--returns if it is a noun, pronoun, verb, adjective, adverb, preposition, conjunction, and interjection

Example:
Dytionary("Dog").defenition() returns this:

"canid; especially : a highly variable domestic mammal (Canis familiaris) closely related to the gray wolf; a male dog; also : a male usually carnivorous mammal; a worthless or contemptible person"
